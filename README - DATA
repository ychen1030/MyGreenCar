Read the following to understand whats going on

First, whats going on with the data...

After you collect data from different trips remember to:
1) put the data as a .csv in the folder called DATA
2) remember to fill in the values in the main_data.csv document


1) To create the astrodek.sqlite database
  1.1 python structuredatabase.py --> this will create the structure needed for the
      data
  1.2 python populatedatabase.py -->  populate the rough data into the table with the
      car's name

  1.3 python clean_database.py -->  cleans up some of the values in the rough
      readings and gives distance between lat and long readings

  1.4 python distance_database.py --> this magic table gives you all you
      need... and also puts up the distance by date

2) To pass the information to the wallflower_db.sqlite
  2.1 python plot_distance.py --> pass the distance measurements to the
      wallflower_db.sqlite database

  2.2 python plot_emissions.py --> pass the emissions measurement to the
      wallflower_db.sqlite database

  2.3 python plot_cost.py --> translates the distance traveled into cost....
      puts it in the wallflower_db.sqlite database

  2.4 python plot_emissions_leaf.py --> translates the distance traveled into
      emissions from generation and distribution of electricity

  2.5 python plot_cost_leaf.py --> translates the distance traveled into cost
      for charging the car. It takes into account the electric cost of PG&E

  2.6 python plot_emission_savings.py --> does some calcs and plots some
      emission savings....

  2.7 python plot_cost_savings.py --> does some calcs and plots cost savings...

  2. localhost --> sit down, grab some popcorn and ....pause for suspense....
      see all the awesome plots....
