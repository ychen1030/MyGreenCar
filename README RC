README: What the program does...
SendData.ino = Obtains data from the photosensor and the button and
controls the LED output intensity. The more light in the room, the less
light it will need, thus the LED fades. This program also receives data
from the ListenAndProcess.py and warns the user that their light intensity
is above 70% of the max by turning ON the integrated LED in port 13 of the
arduino board.

ListenAndSend.py = Listens to the arduino and stores the button state and
the sensor reading directly from the readings. It also does some data
process to obtain the light output percentage (1 min, 100 max)

ListenAndProcess.py = Obtains the last percentage stored in the sql
database and sends a signal to the arduino to turn OFF or ON the integrated
led of the arduino board if the light output is above 70% of the maximum.

ReceiveDatatest.py = I only use the loop function from this program.

StringToInt = I only use the BigList function from this program. To use
the program run (in the following orther) 1. SendData.ino (use configuration
from lab2) 2. Run wallflower_pico_server.py 3. ListenAndSend.py 4.
ListenAndProcess.py 5. Look at readings, cover or uncover sensor to turn
integrated LED on or off.
